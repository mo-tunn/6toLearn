# 6toLearn

6toLearn is a personalized quiz application designed to make English vocabulary learning permanent and effective. Each user creates a custom word list tailored to their needs and adds both the English words and their Turkish meanings to the system. The main goal of the application is to ensure that learned words are stored in long-term memory.

Each word is tested a total of 6 times at specific intervals. When a user answers a word correctly, it progresses one step forward. Words that successfully pass all tests are considered 100% learned. This method prevents forgetting by using a repetition- and reinforcement-based learning model.

The newly integrated GPT 3.5 AI-powered learning module analyzes the words that users struggle with and offers personalized suggestions accordingly. This allows each user to optimize their learning process based on data and achieve more efficient results.

6toLearn focuses on understanding and consistent repetition rather than rote memorization. You can create a personalized learning experience by entering your own words, track your progress, and systematically strengthen your English vocabulary.

üìö 6 words, 6 repetitions, permanent learning.    
ü§ñ Personalized suggestions powered by AI.    
üöÄ Achieve success with your own words!
